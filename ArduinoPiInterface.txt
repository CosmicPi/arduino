As per our discussion from this today please find the encoding of the data stream
sent back from the Arduino over the serial link in ASCII format

Cheers Julian


The version number starts at 1.0 represented by the value 1.0

VER 1.0

The data item lables sent back from the Arduino to th RPi 

HTU 	Humidity and temperature sensor chip
BMP 	Barrometric pressure chip
VIB 	Siesmic vibration event
MAG 	Magnatometer chip
ACL 	Accelerometer chip
LOC 	GPS Location
TIM 	Time stamp
STS 	Firmware/Hardware status
EVT 	Cosmic ray event

		VER,HTU,<TEMPERATURE %5.3f>,<HUMIDITY %4.1f>

		VER,BMP,<TEMPERATURE %5.3f>,<BARROMETRIC PRESSURE %5.3f>

		VER,VIB,<AXIS %d>,<COUNT %d>

		VER,MAG,<X MAGNETIC FIELD GAUSS %5.3f>,<Y MAGNETIC FIELD GAUSS %5.3f>,<Z MAGNETIC FIELD GAUSS %5.3f>

		VER,ACL,<X ACCELERATION M/S/S %3.2f>,<Y ACCELERATION M/S/S %3.2f>,<Z ACCELERATION M/S/S %3.2f>

		VER,LOC,<LATTITUDE DEGREES %5.3f>,<LONGITUDE DEGREES %5.3f>,<ALTITUDE METERS %3.2f>

		VER,TIM,<TIME IN SECONDS SINCE BOOT %4d>,<MASTER CLOCK FREQUENCY HERTZ %7d>,<TIME OF DAY HHMMSS %6s>
N.B
The time of day field is a 6 digit number, eg 093010 is 9AM and 30 minutes 10 seconds
Beware Python would interpret the leading zero to mean Octal and the 9 is an illegal Octal number
Hence the value is actually sent as a string '093010'

		VER,STS,<EVENT QUEUE SIZE %2d>,<MISSED EVENT COUNT %2d>,<TERMINAL IO ERROR %2d>,<TERMINAL MAX BUFFER SIZE %4d>
			<HTU OK FLAG %1d>,<BMP OK FLAG %1d>,<ACL OK FLAG %1d>,<MAG OK FLAG %1d>,<GPS OK FLAG %1d>
			<ADC SAMPLES PER CHANNEL %2d>,<GPS READ INCREMENT %2d>,<EVENT DUMP THRESHOLD %2d>,<ACTIVE CHANNEL MASK>

		VER,EVT,<MASTER CLOCK FREQUENCY HERTZ %7d>,<CLOCK TICKS SINCE LAST EVENT %7d>,<TIME OF DAY HHMMSS %6s>
			<ADC CHANNEL VALUE COUNT %2d>,<AD CHANNEL 0 VALUES %xxxxxxxxx....>,,<AD CHANNEL 1 VALUES %xxxxxxxxx....>

N.B
Channel values are encoded as follows, say <ADC CHANNEL VALUE COUNT %2d> = 8 
then the following CHANNEL VALUES would contain 3 x 8 = 24 Hex digits
Each Hex digit triplet representsd one ADC 12 bit value
Example: 8,ABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABC,123123123123123123123123

==================================

Packet Groupings

On a cosmic ray event the package sent to the server shall contain

EVT,TIM,LOC,HTU,BMP

On a vibration event the package sent to the server shall contain

VIB,TIM,LOC,MAG,ACL

If a weather station is asked for the package sent to the server at intervals of 10 minutes shall contain

TIM,LOC,HTU,BMP

The status shoud be sent every 10 minutes

STS

===================================

Data items will be stored in an SQL data base which will accumilate data items when the internet is not available
When connection to the server is reestablished the items stored in the data base will be sent and the data base emptied

===================================

It might be interesting to implement the concept of subgroups at some higher level
