Testing requirements for PTS
1) Power consumption, not measured, provided it's less than 500mA
2) Serial communications over Programming port (send from Arduino to check it works)
3) I2C line 0 (Due PINS SDA/SCL)
  Write data to and read back: ACCEL/MAG (LMS303), BMP280, HTU21
4) I2C line 1 (Due Pins SDA1 SCL1)
  write data to and read back: MAX5387 variable resistor
5) SPI interfacce
  write data to and read back from MAX1932
6) GPS UART
  write generic text string, read back text string (check what would be a good code to send!)
7) GPS PPS, when signal OK
 check it's roughly 1s between events
8) Bias PSU (MAX1932) set voltage and read back via high impedance potential divider (to be added to PCB).
9) Indicator LED's, make them flash?
10) Amplifiers (both stages tested together)
  with jumper set to test mode, inject via DAC into one channel first, then both channels with second DAC
  verify output at ADC.
